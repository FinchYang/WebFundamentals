# Are designers born or made? {: .page-title }

Welcome to _Designer Vs Developer_, a show that tries to solve the challenges
faced in the industry by opening a conversation between the two, providing
take aways, solutions to workflows, tools and discussions on everyday struggles.

This week Mustafa speaks to Paul Lewis, a Developer Advocate on the
Google Developer Relations Team, about if we are born with a natural
ability to design or develop or whether life opportunities and our
environment that we grew up in dictate our successes.
